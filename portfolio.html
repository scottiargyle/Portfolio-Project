                    <p>I currently work in Application Support for a title insurance company. </p>
                    <p>I started working in my company as an Escrow Assistant in 2021. I was able to quickly learn and grow in that position and within four months was assisting the 
                busiest escrow closer in the Wichita area. After working in that position for just over a year, our company made a switch to a brand new software. This new software 
                was rolled out under some extenuating circumstances and as such was not fully developed or ready for use. </p>
                    <aside>We were building a plane as we were flying it.</aside>
                    <p>I had the opprotunity to learn this software and was able to quickly learn, navigate, and teach my peers. This led me to a new role within the company working with our 
                project manager and a small team to lead the roll out. This involved training, developing, testing and helping build materials to guide staff. </p>
                    <p>This new roll inspired more advanced learning and exploration in the realm of software development. Since beginning this role I have taken it upon myself in my off 
                time to learn front end development. This has helped me build confidence in my communication between the end user and our developers. It has also opened up a new passion
                for coding. </p>
                   <aside>Why? Because coding is fun!</aside>
                    <p>I have used this new found passion to learn HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Github, and NodeJS. I have had the opprotunity to build some great projects which I hope you
                will enjoy viewing below. </p>
